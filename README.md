#### The purpose of this study is to explore some of the different machine learning algorithms visually using python and web scrapping. 
#### To make people understand algorithm more efficient and effective way. 
#### The study seeks to answer the research question, how does the lack of the visual representation affect people’s inclination to machine learning algorithms and their applications in real time scenarios? 
#### The goal is to make an various machine learning algorithms with user interface in which user can choose the type of algorithms to see the step by step procedure to learn that algorithm by real time applications with implementation. 
#### There is a physical influence on this growing trend. Every people learn at different rates, some learn faster when they see visual representation of working. 
#### So the main goal of this project is to try to show some algorithm’s real time work to the students on relevant datasets.
