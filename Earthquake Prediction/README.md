# Earthquake Prediction
The Los Alamos National Laboratory recently made their research data public and hosted a competition on Kaggle so that data scientists everywhere could get a crack at it. The competition closed three months ago, but this was an interesting enough real world problem that I wanted to take a shot at it regardless.
There are 23 columns.
